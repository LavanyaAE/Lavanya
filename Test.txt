JAVA TEST

1.java is a program  file,used to run the byte code.
javac is a program fie located in jdk/bin directory,is used to compile the java file and to generate the byte code.

2.JDK is a Java Development Kit contains tools to execute java program
JRE is a Java Run-Time Environment,contains libraries
JVM is Java Virtual Machine executes the java program

3.Limitations of array
*once the array is declared,we can't modify the order of the elements
*it is difficult access elements without index

4.class is a blueprint to create instances
object is instance of a class
Signature of class
class ClassName
{
}
class: class is a keyword used to declare a class
ClassName: Name of the class
{}:Body of the class

5.Array is a Collection of similar type of data 

6..java file is the program created by developer.
Anyone can understand the .java file, it is written in english language
.java file is used to compile the program
.class file is generated automatically by the compiler when the .java file is compiled
Only machine can understand the .class file
.class file or byte code is used to execute the program.

7.Length of array is 6

8.method signature
 AccessSpecifier Non-AccessSpecifier ReturnType MethodName(parameters)
 {
 }
 Access Specifier can be public,privite,protected
 Non-AccessSpecifier can be static,non-static
 ReturnType can be a void or primitive datatype or non-primitive datatype
 MethodName is a name of the method
 parameters-the local variables declared at the time of method declaration
{} - Body of the method

9.Java is a Object Oriented Programming language
Developed by Games Gossling
Java is popular due to its feature Platform Independent
java is platform independent because of generation of byte code.

10.variables are the containers to strore the address of the data present in a constant pool
Syntax to declare a variable: 
DataType VariableName; this is declaration
DataType VariableName=value; this is declaration and initialization
types of variables:
local variables:which are declared inside a class boundry
static varibles:The variable which have a prefix statc keyword known as static variables

11.Variables which are declared inside a class are known as class variables.

12.DataType is defining the type of data that a variable can hold.
Types
Primitive Data type:int,char,byte,short,double,float,boolean,long
Non-Primitive Data type:String

13.Features of java
Platform independent
It is written in english language
Object Oriented
Security

14.

15.When we try to access the index of an element in the array that is greater than size of the array,compiler prints an error message Index out of Bound

16.System.out.println(); is a statement is used to print the message on the cmd
System:is a pre-defined class
.(Dot):is a operator used to access the class members
out:is a variable
println:is a method()

17.Double equal operator is used to check wheather two reference variables are pointing to the same memory location

18.Dot operator used to access the class members

19.The class which coints the main method

20.public,static,void,for,if,return,all Primitive data types(int,float,double,char,byte,short,long,boolean)
